This scene starts at level 1 where we have an armadillo monster of sorts.
He sits at the center of the scene where he rotates about his center on the y
axis. He is disrupting the forest life found in deeper levels. Level 2 houses
the bunny and male which both rotate on their centers about the y axis. They are
located opposite each other and rotate about the armadillo at the same speed in
the same direction 180 degrees apart. The bunny has 3 plants around it, plant1,
plant2 and plant3 at levels 3, 4 and 5 respectively. The second plant rotates
opposite the first and third and all at different speeds about the bunny. The male
has a bird and three trees rotating about it. The bird immediately rotates around
its head and is at level 3, the trees rotate about the male in the same fashion
as the plants rotate about the bunny, at levels 4, 5 and 6.
